    <strong><u><h1>Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone</h1></u></strong><br>
   <p><strong><h3>A Magical Adventure: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
        Harry Potter is an eleven-year-old orphan who lives a miserable life with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin. But on his eleventh birthday, everything changes! He discovers he's a wizard and is whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        
        Hogwarts is an amazing place, filled with talking portraits, moving staircases, and delicious feasts. Harry makes two great friends, Ron and Hermione, and learns all sorts of cool magic tricks like flying on broomsticks and brewing potions.
        
        There's also a mystery at Hogwarts. Someone is after a powerful stone called the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone in some places). Harry, Ron, and Hermione must use their courage and newfound skills to stop them before it's too late!
        
        What I liked:
        
        The book is full of fun and exciting adventures. You never know what's going to happen next!
        The characters are all really likeable, especially Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They feel like real friends you could have.
        The world of Hogwarts is amazing and full of magical details. It makes you wish you could go to wizarding school too!
        A little bit scary:
        
        There are some bad guys in the book, but they're not too scary. They're mostly after the magic stone, not Harry himself.
        Overall:
        
        Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantastic book that will keep you reading until the very end. It's a great introduction to the wonderful world of Harry Potter and perfect for anyone who loves magic and adventure!</h3></strong></p>
