    <strong><u><h1>Don Quixote</h1></u></strong><br>
    <p><strong><h3>Don Quixote: A Tilting Adventure
        Don Quixote is a funny and strange story about a Spanish nobleman named Alonso Quijano. Alonso loved reading so much, especially books about brave knights, that he started to believe he was one himself! He even renamed himself Don Quixote and set out on adventures with his loyal, but not-so-brave squire, Sancho Panza.
        
        The problem is, the world Don Quixote sees is different from the real world. He mistakes windmills for giants, sheep for armies, and inns for castles. Sancho tries his best to keep Don Quixote grounded, but often gets dragged into his crazy schemes.
        
        The book is full of hilarious situations. Don Quixote charges at windmills, gets thrown in the air, and ends up bruised and battered. He tries to help people, but his good intentions often make things worse.
        
        But Don Quixote isn't just funny. He's also a dreamer who believes in chivalry, justice, and helping the weak. Even though his adventures are wacky, they make you think about what it means to be a good person and to have a good heart.
        
        Would you recommend this book?
        
        If you like to laugh and enjoy a strange but thought-provoking story, then Don Quixote is a good choice.  However, the book can be a bit long and slow-moving at times.</h3></strong></p>
