    <p><strong><h3>A Magical Tournament Takes a Dark Turn: A Review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
        Harry Potter is back for his fourth year at Hogwarts! This time, things are bigger than ever. A huge tournament called the Triwizard Tournament is happening at Hogwarts, with students from other magical schools competing in dangerous challenges. But guess what? Harry gets mysteriously entered even though he's too young!
        
        The book is full of exciting adventures. Harry faces a fire-breathing dragon, gets rescued by mermaids underwater, and even gets lost in a creepy maze. He makes new friends from the other schools, but there's also a scary feeling that something bad is coming.
        
        Things get really serious when bad guys show up and someone important gets hurt. Harry realizes that the world of wizards isn't all fun and games anymore. He has to be braver and stronger than ever before.
        
        What I liked:
        
        The Triwizard Tournament is awesome! It's like the magical Olympics with super cool challenges.
        We learn more about magic from other schools, which is really interesting.
        Harry makes new friends and starts to act more grown-up.
        What I didn't like:
        
        Some parts are a bit scary, especially for younger readers.
        Not everything goes Harry's way, and things can be unfair sometimes.
        Overall:
        
        Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a thrilling adventure with a darker tone than the previous books. It's a great read for anyone who likes magic, friendship, and facing challenges. But be warned, things might get a little spooky!</h3></strong></p><br>
