    <p><strong><h3>It Ends With Us: A Review
        This book tells the story of Lily, a strong woman who runs a successful flower shop. Her life takes a turn when she meets Ryle, a handsome neurosurgeon. Their connection is undeniable, but there's a catch: Ryle doesn't do relationships.
        
        Lily finds herself drawn to him anyway, but things get complicated. Memories of her troubled past with Atlas, her first love, keep resurfacing through letters she wrote back then.
        
        The story goes back and forth between Lily's present life with Ryle and her past with Atlas. We learn they shared a deep love, but something forced them apart.
